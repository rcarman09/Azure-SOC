## Introduction

In this project, I designed a honeynet by deploying Virtual Machines and an SQL Database within Microsoft Azure to collect and analyze log data from various resources. The network security groups were left wide open to internet traffic in order to generate logs. These logs were sent to a Log Analytics workspace, where Microsoft Sentinel was utilized to generate attack maps, issue alerts, and track incidents. To evaluate the effectiveness of security measures, I first measured key metrics in the unsecured environment over a 24-hour period. After implementing security hardening measures, I repeated the monitoring for another 24 hours to observe the impact. The metrics analyzed in this project include:

- SecurityEvent: Windows Event Logs
- Syslog: Linux Event Logs
- SecurityAlert: Alerts triggered by Log Analytics
- SecurityIncident: Sentinel-generated incidents
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL: Malicious network traffic permitted into the honeynet

The mini honeynet architecture deployed in Azure is comprised of the following key components:

 - Virtual Network (VNet)
 - Network Security Groups (NSGs)
 - Virtual Machines: Two Windows and one Linux instance
 - Log Analytics Workspace
 - Azure Key Vault
 - Azure Storage Account
 - Microsoft Sentinel

## Initial ("BEFORE") Configuration:

In the initial setup, all resources were deployed with public exposure to the internet. The Virtual Machines had unrestricted access through both their NSGs and built-in firewalls. Additionally, other resources were accessible via public endpoints without utilizing Private Endpoints, leaving the environment fully exposed.<br>

## Hardened ("AFTER") Configuration:

Following security enhancements, the NSGs were tightened to block all traffic except from my admin workstation. Virtual Machines were further secured by configuring their built-in firewalls, and all other resources were safeguarded by leveraging Private Endpoints, eliminating public exposure.

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our insecure environment for 24 hours:

| **Start Time**            | **Stop Time**            |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| November 15, 2024, 11:18 PM   | November 16, 2024, 11:18 PM  |

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 60746
| Syslog                   | 10174
| SecurityAlert            | 223
| SecurityIncident         | 223
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 3738

## Attack Maps Before Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but after we have applied security controls:
| **Start Time**            | **Stop Time**            |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| November 18, 2024, 8:49 PM   | November 19, 2024, 8:49 PM  |

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 1559
| Syslog                   | 8
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

In this project, a mini honeynet was successfully deployed in Microsoft Azure, with log sources integrated into a centralized Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was utilized to monitor and analyze these logs, triggering alerts and creating incidents based on suspicious activity. Metrics were collected from the unsecured environment prior to implementing any security controls, and then again after applying hardening measures. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in security events and incidents, highlighting the impact and effectiveness of the implemented controls.

It is important to acknowledge that if the resources within the network were subject to higher levels of legitimate user activity, the volume of security events and alerts observed in the 24-hour post-hardening period could have been higher due to an increased attack surface or additional logging generated by normal operations.
